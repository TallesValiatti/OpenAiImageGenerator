# Creating and Manipulating AI-Generated Images with .NET and Azure OpenAI

This repo demonstrates how to integrate Azure OpenAI's DALL-E technology into a .NET application for creating and manipulating AI-generated images.

The code showcases how to harness Azure OpenAI's powerful image generation capabilities by utilizing .NET libraries to interact with the DALL-E model. The application is designed to take a text description, generate a corresponding image, and then process the image data for further use.

This implementation highlights how .NET developers can leverage Azure OpenAI to incorporate advanced AI-driven image creation and manipulation into their applications, enabling new possibilities for creative and data-driven projects.
