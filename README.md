# DALL-E Image Creation and Data Extraction with .NET and Azure OpenAI

This repo is about creating images and extracting their data using .NET and Azure OpenAI's DALL-E technology. Azure OpenAI provides AI models for tasks such as text generation and image creation.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a .NET project, generate an image from a text description, and process the image data. 

The goal is to demonstrate how to leverage Azure OpenAI's capabilities within a .NET environment for creating and manipulating AI-generated images efficiently.
